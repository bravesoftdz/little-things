# Little Things

A pretty 3D game-like experience where you swim towards a sound, using Castle Game Engine.

Using Castle Game Engine, see http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ .

## Compiling

- Download Castle Game Engine
  http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/engine.php

- Install the build tool of Castle Game Engine, see
  https://sourceforge.net/p/castle-engine/wiki/Build%20tool/ .

  Basically, you compile a "castle-engine" program, and place it on $PATH.
  And you set the environment variable $CASTLE_ENGINE_PATH to the directory
  that contains (as a child) castle_game_engine/ directory.

- Compile by simple "make" in this directory.
